## 1. Overall look

The objective of this tool is to design a tool to help my sister out on her **pet-shop and grooming business**. She is starting now, so the tool is for small and emerging business. This tool will be hosted in a **home server** and will only work on her wifi's network, providing safety and reducing her costs. It will be developed using **Shiny and R framework** to improve my skills on those. This administration aid tool will have:

* Inventory control;
* Calendar/Schedules;
* Cash book;
* Prices simulation;
* Clients catalogue;
* Invoice control for taxes;
* Additional security step using login and password;
